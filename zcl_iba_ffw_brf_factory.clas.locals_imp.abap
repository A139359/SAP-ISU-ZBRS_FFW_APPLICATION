* Please note - Naming convention for FFW3 has been discussed with the relevant parties and  *
* has been decided to allow the naming convention for this FFW3 application to use ISU as    *
* the basis for naming objects. I.E. Class names that are FFW3 related use ISU naming stds   *
* even in NON-ISU systems. Have spoken with Brett Campbell and others to agree to this.      *
